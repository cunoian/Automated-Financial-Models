# Automated-Financial-Models
##What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Automated Financial Models

##In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A program that can read aggregated data from a csv file and construct financial models.

##In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will read data collected by a user or data aggregation software (CapitalIQ) from a CSV file and create financial statement forecasts and cash flow business valuations. The software will then output the data to an excel spreadsheet so that the source of the calculation can be viewed.

##If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

##If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Gretl Merges, gretl.merges@temple.edu, Chong Li

##In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

##In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A program that can make a stock price projection.

##In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A program that can make a stock price projection and output it into an excel spreadsheet.

##In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A program that can output a financial statement forecast as well as a DCF model into an excel spreadsheet.

##In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We will need to revisit reading data from CSV files in order to import the data into the python program. We will also need to create models based on those from a previously taken course (Financial Modeling). We will then need to decide how program the assignment, and whether the calculations will be made in the python script or in excel.
